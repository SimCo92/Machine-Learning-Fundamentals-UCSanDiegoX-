# Machine-Learning-Fundamentals-UCSanDiegoX-
Exercises from the EdX course UCSanDiegoX: DSE220x Machine learning fundamentals

This repository was created to complete the "Machine learning fundamentals" course from UCSanDiegoX on EdX.
Every folder is linked to a course week (10 weeks) covering a particular topic in the filed of ML:

● Week 1: Introduction: nearest neighbor, and a host of prediction problems

● Week 2: Probability basics and generative modeling

● Week 3: Linear algebra basics, the multivariate Gaussian, and more generativemodeling

● Week 4: Linear regression and logistic regression

● Week 5: Optimization

● Week 6: Support vector machines

● Week 7: Beyond linear prediction: kernel methods, decision trees, boosting, random forests

● Week 8: Clustering

● Week 9: Informative projections

● Week 10: Deep learning

Is required to use Python Jupyter Notebook to get advantage of easy manipulation of Pyhton scripts.
